## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Add/Remove products from the cart
- Edit product quantities in the cart
- Fill in all fields in the checkout
- Receive form validations if fields are missed or incorrect during checkout
- See correct checkout totals depending on the products in the cart
  - Shipping always adds $50 to the order
  - VAT is calculated as 20% of the product total, excluding shipping
- See an order confirmation modal after checking out with an order summary
- **Bonus**: Keep track of what's in the cart, even after refreshing the browser (`localStorage` could be used for this if you're not building out a full-stack app)

## My process

### Built with

- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [REACTJS] ([JS framework library](https://react.dev/learn/react-developer-tools))
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/) 
- TypeScript



### What I learned
I learnt and advanced my knowledge on using REACTJS context api to allocate cart contents and how to manipulate it.
Additionally I also learnt to use the framer motion to animate my contents


### Continued development
I will continue to use REACTJS to build my frontend application and i will also use REDUX in any next project i build
